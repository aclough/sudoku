Sudoku Collection

I've found I like sudoku solvers a programming exercise, with the
problem being just complex enough to be interesting in forcing you
to think about data structures.  Unfortunatly I lost a few previous
one's I'd done in a computer move (silly, I know) I only have this
Python one that I did for python3 and to explore some new features.

I'll probably try a Haskell one next.
